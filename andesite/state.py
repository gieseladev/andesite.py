"""State handler for Andesite clients.

If you want to store your state externally for example in a database, there
are two approaches you can use. You can either implement the
`AbstractState` and use the default `AndesitePlayerState` (which can be
easily converted to and from JSON), or you can use the default `State`
with a custom `AbstractPlayerState` implementation.
Both approaches have their advantages, but you should always consider that while
the get operations are often performed together (especially during state
migration), the set operations are not.

Attributes:
    StateArgumentType (Union[AbstractState, bool, None]): (Type alias)
        types which can be passed as a state handler to a client.
