A Python client library for [Andesite](https://github.com/natanbc/andesite-node).
andesite.py tries to be as flexible as possible while still providing the same,
consistent API.
The library comes with built-in support for [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py),
but it can be used with any library of your choice.

## The goodies
- Pythonic, fully typed API including all Andesite "entities"
- Client pools with balancing and even state migration. If one node goes down
its players are seamlessly migrated to another one.
- Custom state handlers. andesite.py doesn't force you to use its state manager,
not even for the client pools. It provides you with a solid in-memory one, but
you can swap it out however you want.
- Future-proof design so that if the library becomes outdated it still remains
usable.

## Usage

The following is a small example of how to use andesite.py. For more
in-depth examples and information, please refer to the documentation.

```python
import asyncio

import andesite


client = andesite.create_andesite_client(
    "http://localhost:5000",
    "ws://localhost:5000/websocket",
    None,
    549905730099216384,
)

async def main() -> None:
    result = await client.search_tracks("your favourite song")
    track_info = result.get_selected_track()
    
    # notice that we haven't called any sort of connect method. You can
    # of course manually connect the client, but if you don't that's no
    # biggie because andesite.py will do it for you.
    await client.play(track_info.track)

asyncio.run(main())
```
