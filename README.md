> Why should you use Andesite instead of something like, say, Lavalink?
> Well, one of the biggest, if not the biggest reason to use Andesite is if
> you don't like reading. Lavalink's docs certainly aren't the best, but Andesite's
> are practically non-existent so you can just YOLO through it instead of
> having to properly implement the details. Isn't that great?
